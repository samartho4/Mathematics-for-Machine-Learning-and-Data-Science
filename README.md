## Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science

This repository is kind of collection of all the files, resources, notes, and code that I used to learn Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science. 

### Note:
The repository is not yet fully complete. I am working to compile and organize more materials.

### Folder Structure:
- **Linear Algebra**: Resources covering vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and matrix operations. Linear algebra forms the backbone of many machine learning algorithms, including PCA and neural networks.
  
- **Calculus**: Notes and exercises on calculus concepts, including derivatives, integrals, and limits.

- **Probability and Statistics**: Materials exploring probability distributions, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing. These are crucial for understanding data uncertainty and building probabilistic models.

## Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science

This repository contains materials for learning mathematics for machine learning and data science.

### Folder Structure:
- **Calculus**: Notes and exercises on calculus concepts, including derivatives, integrals, and limits.
- 
- **Linear Algebra**: Resources covering vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and matrix operations. Linear algebra forms the backbone of many machine learning algorithms, including PCA and neural networks.

- **Probability and Statistics**: Materials exploring probability distributions, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing. These are crucial for understanding data uncertainty and building probabilistic models.
